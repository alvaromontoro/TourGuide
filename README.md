# SpotlightJS
SpotlightJS is a JavaScript plugin that helps generate step-by-step instructions and demos in an easy way. It spotlights elements adding small commentary on them. [See a demo working on CodePen](https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/full/bjQYLM/).

It doesn't use clip paths but box-shadows (supported by more browsers) to create a spotlight area that will highlight a specific element, displaying some text (specified as a data-attribute), and jumping from one step to another using CSS transitions.

It is highly customizable, works on desktop and mobile, and users can opt to use the default controls or create their own using the plugin API. Some options are still WIP, but the general functionality is there, and working fine.
