First of all: thanks for wanting to contribute to this project! We really appreciate your time and help.

## Environment

Before jumping into changing any code, please take some time to set up the environment, 
and familiarize yourself with some common tools.

At the moment of developing this project, my IDE of choice was 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). But you could use any other IDE.
Just make sure to have a couple more tools on it:

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint)

That will help keep a similar format in the whole project.

## How to make changes

The process should be pretty standard:

1. Clone/Fork the repo.
2. Install all the dependencies
3. Pick an open issue (please notify first) or suggest a new one.
4. Open it in your favorite IDE (see above).
5. Make the changes.
6. Verify that build and test run correctly.
7. Push your changes.
8. Create a pull request.

Notice that **all code will be reviewed** before it is accepted and merged. 
We will allways leave a comment (and feedback) whatever the case is. 
Please limit the pull request to the issue, and make small commits instead of 
large ones that affect thousands of lines of code.
